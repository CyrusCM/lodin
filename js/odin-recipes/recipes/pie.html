    <h1 style="font-size:xx-large; "> Wonderful Cherry pie !!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;"> Making cherry pie is easy – all you need is a little patience when pitting the cherries. We promise it’s worth it. You can use sweet cherries, sour cherries or a combination of both, just remember to dial the sugar back or up depending on what you choose.</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large">You can buy a cherry pitter, however, if you do not have one try using the thicker round end of a chopstick to push the pits out of the middle of each cherry. Another option is to push each cherry down onto a piping tip. The sugar amount for this recipe varies depending on how sweet your cherries are. Add to your taste. We like to use fresh cherries for this, but you can use canned (see note below).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/2 cups pitted fresh cherries, see note if using frozen or canned (2 1/2 pounds, unpitted)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch</li>
        <li>2/3 to 3/4 cup (135 to 150 grams) sugar, adjusted accordingly to sweetness of cherries</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
