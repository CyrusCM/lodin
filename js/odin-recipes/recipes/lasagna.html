    <h1 style="font-size:xx-large; "> A nice big lasagna !!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;"> This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large"> We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years with Lasagna Soup and even Chicken Lasagna, but we’ve heard again and again from our readers that this is the best lasagna recipe they’ve ever made.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.</li>
        <li>Onion – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
        <li>Red wine (or beef broth) – This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
        <li>Dried thyme – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
    </ul>
